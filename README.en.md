# Swan Input Method

[简体中文](./README.md)

Swan Input Method is a deeply customized Android IME based on [Fcitx5 for Android](https://github.com/fcitx5-android/fcitx5-android).  
The current app name is `天鹅输入法`, and the main package name is `org.fxboomk.fcitx5.android`.

This fork mainly strengthens two areas:

- Clipboard workflow: it turns local clipboard, cross-device clipboard, and image/file clipboard handling into a more complete workflow.
- Prediction and extensibility: it keeps the Fcitx5 multi-engine architecture while further improving extensible scenarios such as the RIME plugin.

## Recent Updates

After consolidating the latest 10 commits, this round of updates mainly falls into the following areas:

- Input state and candidate-bar behavior keep improving:
  - The manually selected keyboard layout is preserved after an input-method restart, and each text-keyboard instance now keeps its own IME state.
  - Horizontal candidate-item spacing is independent from highlight rendering, and paged candidates re-bind correctly to reduce display shifts.
  - Toolbar expand/collapse state handling has been simplified by removing an unnecessary toggle preference, making idle-state feedback more direct.
- Keyboard layouts and button configuration are more flexible:
  - Custom keyboards can toggle the number keyboard, and the layout editor can move a keyboard row upward.
  - Alternate characters for custom keys preserve their original text, uppercase hints can be configured, and customized keys are marked with a distinct editor border.
  - Toolbar buttons support custom icons from drawable resources or iconfont characters, and previews apply custom button icons and inline font sizes.
- Theme, update, and stability maintenance:
  - The theme color editor no longer produces invisible colors when adjusting HSV values with transparency, and previews stay aligned with current keyboard behavior.
  - Application and plugin update downloads now show determinate progress so their state is visible.
  - Color lookup falls back correctly when an Android theme does not provide `colorAccent`, and canceling a gesture dismisses all popups.
- Build and upstream maintenance:
  - Personal build scripts and RIME patch handling have been improved, and related fcitx5 submodules were updated.
  - Localized settings labels and popup-editor wording continue to be refined.

## Highlights

### 1. Stronger clipboard workflow

- Clipboard categories in the main app:
  - Local
  - Other Devices
  - Images & Files
  - All
- Image entries can show thumbnails.
- URL entries support an `Open link` context action.
- Image entries support a `View image` context action via the system default app.
- Image and file clipboard items are preserved as URI-based entries whenever possible, so file sending works beyond plain text.
- Long-text clipboard entries (more than 10 characters) support tokenized/chunked presentation for easier browsing and reuse.
- Clipboard history limits can be configured per category.

### 2. Clipboard sync plugin

The project already integrates the `clipboard-sync` plugin build chain and can build/install it together with the main app.

Currently supported clipboard sync backends:

- [`OneClip`](https://oneclip.cloud/)
- `ClipCascade`
- [`SyncClipboard`](https://github.com/Jeric-X/SyncClipboard)

Plugin capabilities include:

- Automatically pulling desktop clipboard records to Android.
- Supporting multiple clipboard content types including text, images, and files.
- Pushing Android clipboard content back to the server.
- Manually uploading clipboard entries to the server when on-demand sync is needed.
- Background keep-alive, reconnect logic, foreground service mode, and quick settings tile control.
- OneClip pull, push, image, and file downloads support access tokens.
- File sync can save to the configured directory while preserving Unicode characters such as Chinese text in filenames where possible.
- Sync filters for:
  - text length
  - file extensions
  - maximum file size
- Built-in settings for connection testing, push testing, and system clipboard permission guidance.

If your workflow is “copy on desktop, input on phone” or “copy on phone, receive on desktop”, this fork treats it as a core feature.

### 3. Prediction and input-method extensibility

- Keeps the original Fcitx5 multi-language input framework.
- Chinese input continues to support Pinyin, Shuangpin, Wubi, Cangjie, and table-based input methods.
- RIME plugin support remains available for custom schemas, dictionaries, and advanced configuration.
- [`librime` (the Rime plugin)](https://github.com/boomker/librime) prediction capability has been enhanced so it can learn from user input history and supports backup of prediction data.
- Prediction, suggestion, and language-model related capabilities from libime and the Chinese plugin stack are preserved.
- The AI provider list now includes options such as Moonshot.
- AI candidates support an expanded candidate window for browsing more prediction results.
- Horizontal candidate bars support independent item-spacing and highlight styling, with correct refreshes when paging.
- The manually selected keyboard layout is preserved after an input-method restart, reducing unexpected fallback to the default layout.
- The keyboard layer also keeps gaining configurable features such as MacroKey support, Shift behavior switches, and popup gesture highlight improvements.

### 4. Keyboard layout and popup preset sharing

- Text keyboard layouts and popup presets can be shared via QR codes.
- Shared data can be imported either by camera scanning or from a file.
- QR images can be previewed before sharing so you can verify the content first.
- Text keyboard layout JSON also supports direct key color configuration, making it easier to share complete visual layout presets.
- Text keyboard layout JSON supports separate portrait and landscape keyboard-height settings for each layout.
- The keyboard layout editor can move a complete row upward, and alternate characters for custom keys preserve their original text.
- Toolbar and keyboard buttons can be configured to toggle the number keyboard.
- Custom keyboard keys can show configurable uppercase hints, and modified keys are marked with a distinct editor border.
- Popup preset editing can restore default candidate content and continues to support QR import/export.

### 5. Toolbar and UI customization

- Toolbar buttons support both icon-font and drawable-based icon sources, making style unification easier.
- Toolbar button icons can be customized with iconfont code points for a consistent icon-font style.
- Toolbar previews support custom button icons and inline font sizes, with icons tinted according to the active theme.
- The main settings page supports search, including cross-page navigation and automatic positioning of matched settings.
- Layout, key, font, and popup editors use state-aware save icons.
- The input bar includes a more semantic hide-keyboard icon for better visual clarity.
- UI details such as the input method picker, keyboard adjustment overlay, and floating-keyboard state persistence continue to be refined, and layout refresh is more stable when themes change.

### 6. In-app updates and version retrieval

- The About page includes a `Check for updates` entry that compares against the latest stable GitHub Release.
- When a new version is found, the app downloads an APK matching the current package name and device ABI, then lets the user start installation manually.
- Locally built and CI artifacts use a date plus short commit hash in their version segment to make issue tracing easier.
- Application and plugin update downloads show determinate progress and support canceling the current download.

### 7. Multi-theme switching

- Multiple themes can be selected for both light mode and dark mode.
- Tapping the light/dark switch button cycles through the selected themes of the current mode.
- Each mode can keep multiple themes for fast visual switching.
- Theme editing provides explicit save, share, and import actions, while previews stay aligned with current keyboard behavior.

### 8. Preserving the Fcitx5 plugin architecture

- The main app still loads additional input engines or feature plugins through the plugin mechanism.
- Beyond the main app, this repository also includes plugins/components such as RIME, Anthy, UniKey, Thai, Hangul, Sayura, and Jyutping.
- Compatibility with external plugin installation and integration scenarios is preserved.

## Supported input methods

- English
- Chinese
  - Pinyin / Shuangpin / Wubi / Cangjie / custom tables
